# Data management and privacy

## Data collected

### Registration/enrollment data

The data you/your organisation provide on forms to enrol into Green DiSC is collated and kept confidential. The only people having access to it are members of the Green DiSC team, either based at the Software Sustainability Institute or the University of Cambridge.

The data is used to enrol your teams, communicate important information about the scheme, and better understand who is taking part. 

We may share aggregated statistics externally (e.g. number of groups, fields represented, average size of groups etc.). We will not share individual data that can identify you or your organisation without prior consent. 

### Data you store on your Green DiSC Google Drive space

This includes the list of groups enrolled (if you are a central team) as well as all files uploaded on the google drive space. 

Due to the nature of Google Drive, the Green DiSC team can see what is in this space. If this is an issue, you can create a separate space only you can access. This data will not be moved from your space, or shared. 

### Data you submit as part of your application for certification

This data will be shared with the Green DiSC team and the reviewers. It will be requested that all reviewers keep it confidential. This includes basic contact details (name, role, email) of the Green DiSC representative. If you are worried about this, mention it to the Green DiSC team when applying for certification. 

# Data deletion

Your Google Drive space and its content will be deleted upon request and when you notify us that you wish to leave the scheme. 

You can contact us ([info@greendisc.org](mailto:info@greendisc.org)) to request the deletion of particular data.

# Who will be responsible for data management?

Lo√Øc Lannelongue (Green DiSC Lead) and Anica Araneta (Green DiSC coordinator) are primarily responsible for data management and can be contacted by email ([loic@greendisc.org](mailto:loic@greendisc.org) and anica@greendisc.org).
