# Welcome to the Green DiSC Guidelines for Research Group Applicants!

> [!NOTE]
> Last updated 17 Sept 2025 by LoÃ¯c Lannelongue and Anica Araneta

Weâ€™re thrilled to have you join the community of research groups and institutions tackling the environmental impacts of their computing activities.

These guidelines will walk you through the process of applying for a Green DiSC certification. Please take the time to review this document before you start filling out the submission template.

# Applying as a Central Team or Research Group?

You can apply for Green DiSC either as a central team or research group. If youâ€™re certain about which application you should be making, great! Feel free to proceed to the next section.

If youâ€™re unsure about which one to do, our general rule of thumb is this: if you run compute or do research yourself/within your team, then you should be certified as a research group (this is the default level for Green DiSC). On the other hand,  if your team has more of a **facilitator** role, enabling and supporting groups doing research and/or computation, you should apply as a central team. 

We understand that many institutions can have gray areas so if you are still unsure about this, you can email us at [info@greendisc.org](mailto:info@greendisc.org) and we can help.

# Managing the Workspace (Google Drive) 

Regarding your groupâ€™s folder on Google Drive: 

* If a central team from your institution has enrolled before you, we will let them create your groupâ€™s folder as a subfolder of the institutionâ€™s space. This is to facilitate collaboration between you.   
* Otherwise, we will create a standalone folder for your group (it can always be reattached to your institution later).  
* Importantly, this makes no real difference to what you have access to! 

### Organise Files and Add Key Information

Once you have a folder:

1. In your groupâ€™s folder, rename files to replace `<groupâ€™s name>` by the actual name of your group. This is to ensure that the scope and ownership of each file is clear.   
2. Complete the information document (`Key information for Green DiSC in Group X`) with your contact details, and anything else that you may find useful. 

### Managing Access in the Shared Workspace 

You can manage access to a particular folder by doing `right click â†’ share â†’ share â†’ add their email address`.

You should have access to your Green DiSC space, with edit access to your file, and read access to Green DiSCâ€™s central resources (such as this document). If your central team is also doing Green DiSC, you should have read access to a `Shared resources` folder.

You are free to organise files as you see fit, add users to the folder, and you are responsible for restricting access to subfolders appropriately. If your team prefers to use your own shared directory elsewhere (e.g. OneDrive), youâ€™re free to do so. Just a reminder to be mindful of sharing personal information when adding users to your Green DiSC folder.

# Completing the criteria

Weâ€™re glad that your group is taking the first steps towards more environmentally sustainable digital computing.

### What will happen in the application phase? 

The objective of the application phase for either Bronze, Silver, or Gold is to document the activities and initiatives that your group has done and is doing to tackle the environmental impact of your work. Using the Green DiSC criteria as a roadmap, identify the initiatives, policies, processes, and inventory hardware, data resources, computing pipelines, and training materials to understand and show where your group is currently and where there is still room for improvement.

If your central team is also doing Green DiSC, they will be able to provide you with answers for quite a few criteria (for which the answers are the same across the institution), making it easier for you. Thatâ€™s the benefit of doing both central teams and group-level Green DiSC!

The best place for any questions about the criteria, or how to implement them, is the [ESCS forum](https://forum.escs-community.org). And why not have a look in case you can answer questions from others?

### How do I fill up the Criteria and Submission Template? 

The Criteria and Submission Template has three sections to fill up: the cover page, the tracker, and the submission template for each criterion. The cover letter summarises key information about the applicant which you should complete before submitting your application. The tracker allows you to monitor the status of each criterion as you and your team accomplish the criteria over a period of time, as well as allow you to assign different parts of the application to members of your team. Filling this up is completely optional, but it may help you track your progress if you take long breaks between criteria. Finally, the criteria and submission template - the main bulk of this document -  will contain your responses and supporting evidence for the criteria.

> [!TIP]
> **Watch out for this symbol!  ðŸ“£** If you see this symbol on a criterion, this means that you should be able to ask your central team (if they have or are also applying to Green DiSC) about the evidence theyâ€™ve provided for that criterion and what additional information you can provide for your application as a group. In this case, you may not have to do much to tick this box.

### How do I provide sufficient detail for each criterion? 

When filling out the responses, provide clear and complete but succinct answers that show whether youâ€™ve achieved the criteria and how youâ€™ve done so. Provide supporting evidence that directly and explicitly demonstrates the criterion. Make sure files can be opened by others and links are accessible, otherwise provide screenshots instead. Avoid sharing or linking to general documents and websites where it is unclear how the information supports the relevant criterion. When possible, highlight explicit sections of supporting evidence to strengthen your response and make reviewing easier. If any information is sensitive or confidential, you may anonymise or black out these parts in documents.

### How do I submit?

Make sure to take note of the next deadline for submission (check the [webpage](https://www.software.ac.uk/GreenDiSC) for updates!). When youâ€™re ready to submit, save this file as a .docx file and email it to us with your supporting documents at [info@greendisc.org](mailto:info@greendisc.org). Once we receive it, expect an acknowledgement email confirming your submission.

### What happens after submission? 

After the deadline, we will allocate peer reviewers for your application and give everyone a few weeks to complete the reviews. Then we will give you sufficient time to respond to your reviewersâ€™ comments and make required adjustments (if any), and the final outcome will be communicated to you around 3 months after the deadline, with certificates awarded shortly after.

# How long is the certification valid for? 

Teams are expected to apply for recertification 2 years after their last audit. The recertification process will be of course lighter touch, mostly to check that the actions are still in place and align with updated criteria. The Green DiSC team will be publishing guidelines on the recertification process in the coming months.
