# Bronze criteria for research groups

## Green DiSC Representative

![Category general](https://img.shields.io/badge/category-general-blue)
![Criteria ID](https://img.shields.io/badge/Criteria%20ID-(RG)%20G1--B-white)

Nomination of at least one Green DiSC representative ensures there is a lead taking ownership of sustainability efforts in the group and in this Green DiSC submission. Should they leave, they must pass on responsibilities.

### Why? 
Continuity is crucial to all sustainability initiatives, and is the sign of a truly successful effort. Ensure that someone is nominated to carry forward the targets laid out in this framework. 

### How?
A member of staff takes on the responsibility, and makes sure to pass it on when they leave. When initiating a sustainability initiative, make any relevant sustainability/environmental/ facilities teams aware. They can sometimes provide support or guidance. 

### Acceptable Evidence
Contact details of the DiSC representative, inclusion of this in their job description and/or their institutional profile page. 

## Computing sustainability in induction procedures 

![Category general](https://img.shields.io/badge/category-general-blue)
![Criteria ID](https://img.shields.io/badge/Criteria%20ID-(RG)%20G2--B-white)

There is induction material available to all new starters to emphasise the importance of adopting efficient and sustainable practices from day one.

### Why? 
While there may be a substantial amount of information for new starters, it is crucial that efficient and sustainable practices are emphasised on arrival. It is during this period of initiation that people are most impressionable, despite there being a lot of new information. 

### How? 
Sustainability induction procedures can be provided by the central team, or inspired from examples in other institutions. Sustainable practices should not be separate, but rather fully integrated into induction materials. This refers to training about digital and computing sustainability, not generic campus sustainability efforts. Some resources used/shared by others include the [Green Software Practitioner Course](https://learn.greensoftware.foundation/) and the [Green HPC system use](https://epcced.github.io/2025-07-02_GreenHPC_UCL/). 

### Acceptable evidence: 
Material and evidence of it being used. Provide detail on how these are disseminated and made accessible to new starters. 

*ðŸ“£ Ask your Central Team! If your central team has applied or is applying to Green DiSC as well, you should be able to ask them about the evidence they provided for this criterion and what relevant information is available for you to include in your application.*


<!-- Criteria below need to be adapted the same way -->

Category: General | Criteria ID: (RG) G3-B

## Resources are shared with other groups  {#resources-are-shared-with-other-groups}

---

#### Information collected that could be useful to other groups in the institution (e.g. data centres specs) are shared with a central team and/or other groups engaging with this framework. Material created or improved (e.g. induction or training) is being shared with other groups on the [Green DiSC forum](https://forum.escs-community.org/c/green-disc/9).

| Why? Sharing resources is a great way to avoid duplicating efforts and increase adoption. How? Through a central sustainability platform and sharing externally on the Green DiSC forum(s). Acceptable evidence: Details of resources shared, with the way it was shared and the number of people shared with. |

## Dissemination of this program in the institution {#dissemination-of-this-program-in-the-institution}

---

#### The group is engaging with other groups in the institution to increase participation and adoption for the sustainability program.

| Why? Aside from shared resources, sharing experiences, tips, and best practices with other groups encourages engagement and helps grow and strengthen a community within your institution dedicated to sustainability. How? Through engagement with other labs, mailing lists, department policies etc. Acceptable evidence: Details of promotion activities undertaken. |

## Computing hardware inventory {#computing-hardware-inventory}

---

#### There is a list of the different computing hardware used by the group (not personal equipment), as well as suppliers and warranty policies that apply. This list is updated yearly and includes laptops, desktop computers, monitors, tablets, and external hard drives. This should not include HPC equipment, as this is a separate criteria. In the case where a personal device is used significantly for work (e.g. a student using their own laptop), then this may be included for monitoring purposes.

| Why? Manufacturing and end-of-life treatment for hardware can outweigh the environmental impacts of the usage phase. How? List the hardware by linking with colleagues and confirming with finance/operation/IT teams. Where data is missing, this should be clearly highlighted so that it can be revisited in the future. Acceptable evidence: Filled inventory. You may use [this template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GEUPeHO6CnJhCOhJHdSKYH6c0cKhPyXy3UUZzWpv7WI/edit?gid=0#gid=0) created by a previous awardee as reference, just download a copy if you would like to adopt the table(s). |

## Unused computing equipment inventory {#unused-computing-equipment-inventory}

---

#### Similar to the previous criterion, there is also a list of unused computing equipment, including  laptops, desktop computers, monitors, tablets, and external hard drives available to the group, with information on actions to be taken for each.

| Why? Manufacturing and end-of-life treatment for hardware can outweigh the environmental impacts of the usage phase.  How? List the unused equipment by linking with colleagues and confirming with finance/operation/IT teams. Acceptable evidence: Filled inventory, with the list of actions taken for each. |

## E-waste processing streams and institution/group policy {#e-waste-processing-streams-and-institution/group-policy}

---

#### There is documentation of how electronic waste is dealt with in your group, including institutional policies on repurposing, reusing, and disposing unused equipment and parts.

| Why? Manufacturing and end-of-life treatment for hardware can outweigh the environmental impacts of the usage phase. How? List of disposing streams from institution guidelines, IT teams, sustainability teams, users' feedback, etc. Acceptable evidence: List of waste streams with information on what happens to hardware, including e-waste repurpose, reuse, and disposal policy, if available. Provide clear and concise detail on the e-waste processes of your group/institution, providing screenshots and supporting information when possible. ðŸ“£Ask your Central Team\! If your central team has applied or is applying to Green DiSC as well, you should be able to ask them about the evidence they provided for this criterion and what relevant information is available for you to include in your application. |

Category: Data Storage | Criteria ID: (RG) DS1-B

## Data resource inventory {#data-resource-inventory}

---

#### There is an inventory of the main data resources used and/or managed by the group, including information on its storage location, its value (e.g. difficult to replace if lost), and its size. All datasets used (not only managed) by the group that satisfy one of these criteria should be listed. This inventory is updated regularly (frequency depends on field, at least yearly).

| Why? Identifying all large datasets is a crucial first step to finding ways to mitigate the associated impact on the environment. How? List the data resources by linking with colleagues and confirming with IT teams. If you are just a user of this dataset (hosted by an external organisation), the listing can be quite short. More details should be provided on data you host yourself (such as size, location etc.). Acceptable evidence: List of data resources. You may use [this template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GEUPeHO6CnJhCOhJHdSKYH6c0cKhPyXy3UUZzWpv7WI/edit?gid=0#gid=0) created by a previous awardee as reference, just download a copy if you would like to adopt the table(s). |

Category: Data Storage | Criteria ID: (RG) DS2-B

## Data directory cleaning {#data-directory-cleaning}

---

#### There is a clear and regularly occurring process (quarterly is ideal) for cleaning of data directories that are used and maintained by users of the group. This process should cover regular reminders for deletion of temporary/outdated tiles. Data directories in this case refer to those managed by individual team members for their own projects.

| Why? Users' data directories tend to accumulate temporary files that hoard space unnecessarily. How? Organise regular cleaning in coordination with central IT teams and users. Acceptable evidence: Proof of the last cleaning happening, description of the scope covered and storage freed. Include detail on the frequency and next scheduled cleaning, if available. |

Category: Compute | Criteria ID: (RG) HPC1-B

## Computing infrastructure inventory {#computing-infrastructure-inventory}

---

#### There is a list of the computing infrastructures used by the group, that is both on-site (e.g. local or institutional data centres, servers in the office) and off-site (e.g. remote institutional computing facilities and commercial cloud providers), including information on the electricity sources of each infrastructure (either main power grid, most common, or dedicated facility such as a solar farm). Any infrastructure that the group is using (or can be reasonably expected to use at some point) should be included.

| Why? The first step to addressing the impact of computing is to have an understanding of the usage. This can allow long-term comparisons and sustainability strategies to be addressed, and alerts facilities that sustainability is a priority. How? The following information should be listed: location of the data centre(s), Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) of these data centres and hardware being used (this will be useful for carbon monitoring of your project). For cloud providers: company providing the service, location of the data centres, PUE and hardware if you can find it. For data about institutional data centres, the information should be straightforward to obtain by contacting the computing team. If youâ€™re using your own computing infrastructure, e.g. servers in the office, the reason for doing so should be stated.  Acceptable evidence: List of the computing infrastructures with appropriate details (e.g. on-site or off-site, electricity source). You may use [this template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GEUPeHO6CnJhCOhJHdSKYH6c0cKhPyXy3UUZzWpv7WI/edit?gid=0#gid=0) created by a previous awardee as reference, just download a copy if you would like to adopt the table(s). |

Category: Compute | Criteria ID: (RG) HPC2-B

## Computing pipeline inventory {#computing-pipeline-inventory}

---

#### There is a list of the computing pipelines run by the group with information on which ones are the most demanding (if any), either because of long runtimes or large number of resources, or because the same pipeline is run a large number of times.

| Why? The first step to addressing the impact of computing is to have an understanding of the usage. This can allow long-term comparisons and sustainability strategies to be addressed, and alerts facilities that sustainability is a priority.  How? By linking with colleagues and IT teams as necessary. Acceptable evidence: List of computing pipelines. Include detail on metric used for demand (e.g. runtime, number of resources, number times run). You may use [this template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GEUPeHO6CnJhCOhJHdSKYH6c0cKhPyXy3UUZzWpv7WI/edit?gid=0#gid=0) created by a previous awardee as reference, just download a copy if you would like to adopt the table(s). |

Category: Compute | Criteria ID: (RG) HPC3-B

## Green computing best practices {#green-computing-best-practices}

---

#### The group raises awareness, educates, and shares information on green computing best practices with its team members, and documents tips that are relevant to the groupâ€™s work. This can include reducing re-run analysis when not necessary, how to debug on a small scale and use checkpointing to limit unnecessary runs, and known coding optimisation best practices relevant to the group's activities.

| Why? The first step to addressing the impact of computing is to have an understanding of the usage. This can allow long-term comparisons and sustainability strategies to be addressed, and alerts facilities that sustainability is a priority.  How? Institutions can leverage already available training material online, or design their own. More material should be made freely available in coming months, but in the meantime, recorded talks on the Green Algorithms page (www.green-algorithms.org) can be used as a starting point for example. Acceptable evidence: List of training resources offered. Provide detail on how this is disseminated and made accessible. Date and attendance list of the training sessions(s). Documents used for training (including tips that are specific to the lab). You may use [this template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GEUPeHO6CnJhCOhJHdSKYH6c0cKhPyXy3UUZzWpv7WI/edit?gid=0#gid=0) created by a previous awardee as reference, just download a copy if you would like to adopt the table(s). ðŸ“£Ask your Central Team\!
