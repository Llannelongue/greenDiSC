![Criteria ID](https://img.shields.io/badge/Criteria%20ID-(CT)%20G2--B-white)

There is induction material available to all new starters to emphasise the importance of adopting efficient and sustainable practices from day one.

### Why?
While there may be a substantial amount of information for new starters, it is crucial that efficient and sustainable practices are emphasised on arrival. It is during this period of initiation that people are most impressionable, despite there being a lot of new information.

### How?
Template induction material is made available, and there is a process to encourage individual groups to take it up. Some resources used/shared by others include the [Green Software Practitioner Course](https://learn.greensoftware.foundation/) and the [Green HPC system use](https://epcced.github.io/2025-07-02_GreenHPC_UCL/).

### Acceptable Evidence
Induction and training materials, evidence of these being shared, and examples of use by new starters. Provide detail on how these are disseminated and made accessible to new starters.

ðŸ“£ *Share your response with your groups! If there are other research groups from your institution also enrolled in Green DiSC and you help facilitate their work, they may reach out to you about the evidence you provide in this criterion to help them with their application.*
